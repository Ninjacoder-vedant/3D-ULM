🔹 A single complex sample
🔹 Real = 13037.623
🔹 Imag = -6080.5986
🔹 Stored in MATLAB as a 2-field struct
🔹 Loaded by h5py as a np.void record
🔹 You must convert it to Python complex using .view(np.complex64) or manual extraction.

### Timeline

**06/12/2025**
- Read about the 2x2D paper, tried to implement it, but it doesn't work
- Then I thought to run the pipeline, I kept it on ruunning using `nohup` and slept

**07/12/2025**
- Saw the results generated by their code, seems like they just provide MIP visualization, need to identify how to calculate output_density form track data and give it to amira for 3D visualization
- Need to write commented code to understand what the code exactly is doing, used ChatGPT
